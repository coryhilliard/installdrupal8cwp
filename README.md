# Drupal 8 Installer Script for CentOS 7 Control Web Panel

This is a quick installer script for installing Drupal 8 on CWP which is built on CentOS 7.  It took me a while to debug the installation, which used to take a couple of minutes to install.  However, Drupal 8 comes with Clean URLs enabled by default, which makes things difficult if your server isn't set up EXACTLY as Drupal 8 requires.

I am giving this work away free as Drupal, CentOS and CWP are all open source projects.  I'm a huge believer in leapfrogging over the work of others to build greater things.  I don't want the days I spent debugging this to be repeated by anyone.  Please read the walkthrough and the installer script before using.  I would like you to know how it works and there are important settings to change after Drupal 8 has been installed.
